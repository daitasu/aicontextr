# Frontend Development Introduction

This document provides an overview of our frontend development standards and practices.

## Tech Stack

Our frontend stack consists of:
- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## Code Organization

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/         # Page-level components
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── utils/         # Utility functions
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
└── styles/        # Global styles and themes

## Development Principles

1. **Component-First Design** - Build reusable, composable components
2. **Type Safety** - Use TypeScript for all code
3. **Performance** - Optimize for Core Web Vitals
4. **Accessibility** - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
5. **Testing** - Unit tests for all components

## Getting Started

To begin frontend development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your changes
